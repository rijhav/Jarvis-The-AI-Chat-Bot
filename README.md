#Jarvis The AI Chat Bot

This project entailed an original investigation into any area of application of Natural Language Processing. My partner and I decided to build an AI chat bot for a 
restaurant. The chat bot acts as the waiter and carries out the tasks of the waiter. We were required to show sensitivity to linguistic phenomena and an ability to 
model them with formal grammars. We were tested on our ability to sample machine learning techniques and assessing which ones are suitable for a given problem. 
We had to understand and carry out proper experimental methodology for training and empirically evaluating NLP systems. We then had to implement our NLP solution 
using some NLP library. We were also required to a write up and oral presentation for the project describing our approach, results and data analysis.
